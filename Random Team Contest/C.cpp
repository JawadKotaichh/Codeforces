/*
    we have n flowers
    The ith flower have value a[i]
    The girlfriend can only step between ajacent flowers that have the same value
    
    If her energy >0 it gives 1 to the value of flower she is on 
    She can take 1 from the value of the flowe and gain 1 unit of energy

    She will ask you 1 p where p is the  flower she starts with
    Goal: the minimum needed energy to visit all flowers

    2 p x means that flower p has value x now


    ex: 3 1 3
    starts at flower 1
    3 1 3
    2 2 3 at 2
    2 3 3 at 3

    if she is at a flower she wants to go to all the others so she has a goal to take the most eneery she can
    from the currrent one if the current one greater than the next else she want to have the neccesary energy 
    to proceed
